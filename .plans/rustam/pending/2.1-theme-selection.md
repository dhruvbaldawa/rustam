# Task 2.1: Theme Selection UI

## Goal

Allow host to choose a theme for each round instead of auto-cycling through predefined themes.

## Working Result

- Host sees theme selector before starting each round
- Can choose from predefined themes or "Random"
- Selected theme is used for that round's role assignments
- Players see the chosen theme on their role reveal screen

## Constraints

- Must work with existing round cycling logic
- Theme list should be easily extensible
- "Random" option should pick from full theme list

## Dependencies

None - builds on existing theme infrastructure in RoomContext.

## Current Implementation

Themes are currently defined in `src/contexts/RoomContext.tsx`:
```typescript
const THEMES = ['Kitchen Appliances', 'Vehicles', 'Furniture', 'Animals', 'Fruits'];
const getThemeForRound = (roundNumber: number) => THEMES[(roundNumber - 1) % THEMES.length];
```

The `startRound()` function auto-selects theme based on round number.

## Suggested Approach

1. **Extract themes to shared constant** - Move THEMES array to a shared location (e.g., `src/lib/themes.ts`)

2. **Add theme selection to Lobby** - Before "Start Game", show theme picker:
   - Dropdown or grid of theme options
   - "Random" option at top (recommended default)
   - Preview of selected theme

3. **Update startRound()** - Accept optional `selectedTheme` parameter:
   - If provided, use that theme
   - If "random" or undefined, use existing auto-selection logic

4. **Consider UX**:
   - Should host select theme before EACH round or just first?
   - For MVP: Select once at game start, use for all rounds (simpler)
   - Future: Per-round selection in Game.tsx before "Next Round"

## Theme Ideas (Expand List)

Consider adding more themes:
- Sports Equipment, Musical Instruments, Office Supplies
- Board Games, Snacks, Countries, Movies, TV Shows
- Occupations, Clothing Items, School Subjects
