# Task 1.2: Room Creation

## Goal

Host can create a room with a unique 4-digit code, displayed with a QR code for easy joining.

## Working Result

- Host clicks "Host Game" and gets a unique 4-digit room code
- Room is created in Firebase Realtime Database
- Host sees lobby screen with large room code AND scannable QR code
- QR code links directly to join URL with room code pre-filled
- Room code is collision-safe (no duplicates)

## Constraints

- 4-digit numeric codes only (easy to say aloud as backup)
- Room must be linked to host's anonymous UID
- Store room code in localStorage for reconnection
- QR code must be large enough to scan from across the room

## Dependencies

- Task 1.1 (Firebase setup, auth working)

## Room Code Generation

Generate random 4-digit code, check if exists in Firebase, retry if collision.

## QR Code

Use a library like `qrcode.react` or `react-qr-code`:

```bash
pnpm add react-qr-code
```

QR code should encode the full join URL:

```
https://[your-domain]/play?code=7294
```

This way players scan and go directly to join screen with code pre-filled.

## Database Structure

```
rooms/
  {roomCode}/
    hostUid: "abc123"
    status: "lobby"
    currentRound: 0
    totalRounds: 4
    createdAt: timestamp
```

## Host Reconnection

After creating room, store in localStorage:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('rustam_host_room', roomCode);
```

On app load, check if host has an active room and restore session.

## Lobby Screen Layout

- Room code LARGE (64px+ per PRD) at top
- QR code below (at least 200x200px for easy scanning)
- "Scan to join" label under QR
- "Or enter code: 7294" fallback text
- Player count (wired up in next task)
- "Start Game" button (disabled until 4+ players)

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Clicking "Host Game" creates room in Firebase
- [ ] Room code appears on screen (large, readable)
- [ ] QR code is displayed and scannable
- [ ] Scanning QR code opens join page with code pre-filled
- [ ] Room code is 4 digits
- [ ] Creating multiple rooms produces different codes
- [ ] Room data visible in Firebase Console
- [ ] Refreshing page as host returns to same lobby
- [ ] `hostUid` in Firebase matches authenticated user's UID
